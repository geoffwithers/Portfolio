Geoff Withers Software Development Portfolio

This project is a site that will serve as my professional portfolio. I have created the basic functions, and plan to improve the content and quality of the portfolio as I progress in bootcamp.

As of 2/6/23, this project contains only HTML and CSS work.

Deployed app: https://geoffwithers.github.io/Portfolio/
